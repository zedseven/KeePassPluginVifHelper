# KeePassPluginVifHelper
A small tool for signing and preparing a KeePass Plugin Version Information File.
Complies with the instructions specified [on the KeePass Password Safe website](https://keepass.info/help/v2_dev/plg_index.html#upd) as of 2019-12-16.

This is by no means a polished and bulletproof program, but it works and makes preparing a Version Information File for a KeePass plugin much easier.
